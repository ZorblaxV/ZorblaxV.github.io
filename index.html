	<p> This is a paragraph! :) </p>
		<p> And this is another paragraph! <br /> Bam! </p>
		<p> And here is an invisible hamster eating: </p>
			<hr />
		<p> Here is a list of things on this page: </p>
		<ol>
			<li> The moronic title in decreasing font size </li>
			<li> The first paragraph which proudly declares that it is a paragraph and smiles at the reader </li>
			<li> The second paragraph which also declares its own paragraph-hood but with no smile (I call this the 'grumpy paragraph') </li>
			<li> The line about the hamster picture </li>
			<li> The picture of the hamster</li>
			<li> The rickrolling hyperlink ... I mean, the link to the cute video about hamsters! (phew, saved it) </li>
			<li> The stupid section about bullet points underneath this</li>
			<li> Some other boring stuff that I can't be bothered to mention </li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li> I could have ordered the list above using bullet points like this one instead of numbers if I wanted to </li>
			<li> But I didn't </li>
		</ul>
